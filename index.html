Ringing clear and true.
Singing Carolina’s praises,
Shouting N-C-U!

Hail to the brightest star of all,
Clear its radiance shine.
Carolina, Priceless Gem,
Receive all praises thine.

I believe it’s true that North Carolina is a Priceless Gem (as described in the University of North Carolina’s alma mater above) and, like James Taylor, I will forever be “gone to Carolina in my mind.”

However, I also love to travel. I love visiting other places and uncovering other “priceless gems”.

As a travel agent, I love helping other people curate and plan custom vacations so that they can do the same.

I look forward to helping you customize your next adventure to one of the many “priceless gems” of the world.")
